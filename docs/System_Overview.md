# System Overview

The DIY Dillon 1050 Autodrive motorizes the press and adds sensors, logging, and a networked UI. The design focuses on safety-first automation with hard-stop interlocks and clear diagnostics.

- **Motorized Stroke** with driver/VFD/servo (final selection TBD by user hardware)
- **Safety & Interlocks**: E-stop, powder & primer faults, cycle position sensing
- **Data Model** for production/QC and traceable ammunition batches
- **Optional Vision**: bullet orientation verification; OAL tolerance and finished-round counting
- **Touch UI** hosted on the Pi (also accessible over LAN on mobile devices)
