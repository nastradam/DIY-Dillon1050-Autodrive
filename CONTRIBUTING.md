# Contributing

We welcome issues, ideas, and pull requests. This project prioritizes **reliability**, **cost effectiveness**, and **DIY friendliness**.

## Principles
- Prefer off-the-shelf components (Adafruit/Amazon) with clear alternatives.
- Keep the control stack simple and observable.
- Design-first safety; no compromises.

## Development
- Use feature branches: `feature/<short-name>`
- Write docs for every new module in `docs/`
- Follow SemVer; update `VERSION` and `CHANGELOG.md` accordingly.
